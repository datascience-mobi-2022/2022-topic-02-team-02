   abstract = {Cancer cells rewire their metabolism to promote growth, survival, proliferation, and long-term maintenance. The common feature of this altered metabolism is the increased glucose uptake and fermentation of glucose to lactate. This phenomenon is observed even in the presence of completely functioning mitochondria and, together, is known as the 'Warburg Effect'. The Warburg Effect has been documented for over 90 years and extensively studied over the past 10 years, with thousands of papers reporting to have established either its causes or its functions. Despite this intense interest, the function of the Warburg Effect remains unclear. Here, we analyze several proposed explanations for the function of Warburg Effect, emphasize their rationale, and discuss their controversies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the therapy is constrained by drug resistance. Therefore, further characterization of immune infiltration in ccRCC is needed to improve its efficacy. METHODS: Here, we adopted the CIBERSORT method to analyze the level of 22 immune cells, and analyzed the correlation of immune cells and clinical parameters in ccRCC in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We used consensus clustering to cluster ccRCC and identified differently expressed genes (DEGs) between hot and cold tumors using the "Limma" package, and then performed enrichment analysis of DEGs. Finally, we constructed and validated a Cox regression model using the "survival", "glmnet", and "survivalROC" packages, implemented in R. RESULTS: Regulatory T cells upregulated in tumor tissue increased during tumor progression, and correlated with poor overall survival in ccRCC. Consensus clustering identified four clusters of ccRCC. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of immune cell infiltration, we subdivided these four clusters into two major types, immune hot and cold, and identified DEGs between them. The results revealed different transcription profiles in the two tumor types, with hot tumors being enriched in immune-related signaling, whereas cold tumors were enriched in extracellular matrix remodeling and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathway. We further identified hub genes and prognostic-related genes from the DEGs, and constructed a Cox regression model for predicting the overall survival of patients with ccRCC. The areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the risk model for the training, testing, and external Zhengzhou validation cohorts were 0.834, 0.733, and 0.812, respectively. Notably, gene sets in the prediction model could also predict the overall survival of patients receiving immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a comprehensive characterization of immune infiltration in ccRCC, while the constructed model can be used effectively to predict the overall survival of ccRCC patients.},

Phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated by IL-2. However, nuclear targets for PI3K are not known. Here we identify the cell cycle regulator E2F as an IL-2 target in T lymphocytes and PI3K as the critical signaling pathway. We eliminate both Stat5 and Raf/MEK pathways from E2F regulation. Protein kinase B (PKB) is activated by IL-2 via PI3K. The expression of an active PKB is sufficient to induce E2F activity. Inhibition of PI3K inhibits phosphorylation of Rb, induction of cyclin D3, and degradation of p27kip1. These results establish a crucial PI3K/PKB-mediated link between the IL-2 teceptor and the cell cycle machinery.},

   abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma is the most common form of the kidney cancer accounting for more than 85% of the cases of which clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the major histological subtype. The central molecular signature for ccRCC pathogenesis is the biallelic inactivation of VHL gene due to the presence of mutations/hyper-methylation/complete gene loss, which results in the downstream HIF activation. These events lead to increased tyrosine kinase receptor signalling pathways (RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and NF-κB pathway), which through their downstream effector proteins causes the cell to proliferate and migrate. Recent studies have shown that VHL inactivation alone is not sufficient to induce the tumor. Mutations in numerous other genes that codes for chromatin modifiers (PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1) and signalling proteins (PTEN and mTOR) have been identified along with activation of alternate signalling pathways like STAT and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. It has also been shown that STAT pathway also works cooperatively with HIF to enhance the tumor progression. However, SHH pathway reactivation resulted in tumor regardless of the VHL status, indicating the complex nature of the tumor at the molecular level. Therefore, understanding the complete aetiology of ccRCC is important for future therapeutics.},

   abstract = {Unlike early clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), locally advanced and metastatic ccRCC present poor treatment outcomes and prognosis. As immune checkpoint inhibitors have achieved favorable results in the adjuvant treatment of metastatic ccRCC, we aimed to investigate the immunogenomic landscape during ccRCC progression and its potential impact on immunotherapy and prognosis. Using multi-omics and immunotherapy ccRCC datasets, an integrated analysis was performed to identify genomic alterations, immune microenvironment features, and related biological processes during ccRCC progression and evaluate their relevance to immunotherapy response and prognosis. We found that aggressive and metastatic ccRCC had higher proportions of genomic alterations, including SETD2 mutations, Del(14q), Del(9p), and higher immunosuppressive cellular and molecular infiltration levels. Of these, the Del(14q) might mediate immune escape in ccRCC via the VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, immune-related pathways associated with ccRCC progression did not affect the immunotherapeutic response to ccRCC. Conversely, cell cycle pathways not only affected ccRCC progression and prognosis, but also were related to ccRCC immunotherapeutic response resistance. Overall, we described the immunogenomic characteristics of ccRCC progression and their correlations with immunotherapeutic response and prognosis, providing new insights into their prediction and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.},

Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are highly immune infiltrated, but the effect of immune heterogeneity on clinical outcome in ccRCC has not been fully characterized. Here we perform paired single-cell RNA (scRNA) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of 167,283 cells from multiple tumor regions, lymph node, normal kidney, and peripheral blood of two immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-naïve and four ICB-treated patients to map the ccRCC immune landscape. We detect extensive heterogeneity within and between patients, with enrichment of CD8A+ tissue-resident T cells in a patient responsive to ICB and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in a resistant patient. A TCR trajectory framework suggests distinct T cell differentiation pathways between patients responding and resistant to ICB. Finally, scRNA-derived signatures of tissue-resident T cells and TAMs are associated with response to ICB and targeted therapies across multiple independent cohorts. Our study establishes a multimodal interrogation of the cellular programs underlying therapeutic efficacy in ccRCC.}

abstract = {Abstract During chronic viral infection or cancer, the immune system usually induces a corresponding immune response against pathogens or cancer cells so as to prevent worsening disease. T cell exhaustion in which reduced and dysfunctional effector T cells lead to immune escape is one of the mechanisms that pathogens or cancer cells get rid of control from the immune system. In this review, we discuss some mechanisms associated with T cell exhaustion and enumerate current methods of reversing T cell exhaustion. We also summarize current targeted treatment strategies and put forward following aspects that required to research.},

abstract = {Summary
We performed an extensive immunogenomic analysis of more than 10,000 tumors comprising 33 diverse cancer types by utilizing data compiled by TCGA. Across cancer types, we identified six immune subtypes—wound healing, IFN-γ dominant, inflammatory, lymphocyte depleted, immunologically quiet, and TGF-β dominant—characterized by differences in macrophage or lymphocyte signatures, Th1:Th2 cell ratio, extent of intratumoral heterogeneity, aneuploidy, extent of neoantigen load, overall cell proliferation, expression of immunomodulatory genes, and prognosis. Specific driver mutations correlated with lower (CTNNB1, NRAS, or IDH1) or higher (BRAF, TP53, or CASP8) leukocyte levels across all cancers. Multiple control modalities of the intracellular and extracellular networks (transcription, microRNAs, copy number, and epigenetic processes) were involved in tumor-immune cell interactions, both across and within immune subtypes. Our immunogenomics pipeline to characterize these heterogeneous tumors and the resulting data are intended to serve as a resource for future targeted studies to further advance the field.}

   abstract = {Metabolic reprogramming provides critical information for clinical oncology. Using molecular data of 9,125 patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified tumor subtypes in 33 cancer types based on mRNA expression patterns of seven major metabolic processes and assessed their clinical relevance. Our metabolic expression subtypes correlated extensively with clinical outcome: subtypes with upregulated carbohydrate, nucleotide, and vitamin/cofactor metabolism most consistently correlated with worse prognosis, whereas subtypes with upregulated lipid metabolism showed the opposite. Metabolic subtypes correlated with diverse somatic drivers but exhibited effects convergent on cancer hallmark pathways and were modulated by highly recurrent master regulators across cancer types. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrated that knockdown of SNAI1 or RUNX1-master regulators of carbohydrate metabolic subtypes-modulates metabolic activity and drug sensitivity. Our study provides a system-level view of metabolic heterogeneity within and across cancer types and identifies pathway cross-talk, suggesting related prognostic, therapeutic, and predictive utility.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},
